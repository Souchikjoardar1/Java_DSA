         * An ObjectOutputStream is created, which allows Java objects to be written to
         * the file in a serialized format.
         * A FileOutputStream is created to write data to a file named Revision.txt
         * located in the Revision directory.
         * Writing the Object to the File:
         * 
         * oos.writeObject(c); The Cricketer object (c) is serialized and written to the
         * file Revision.txt.
         * FileOutputStream
         * Purpose: It is used to write raw data (like bytes) to a file.
         * What it does in your code:
         * This creates a connection to the file Revision.txt in the specified directory
         * (Revision).
         * It prepares the file to receive data. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it will
         * create it.
         * Think of it as opening a pipeline to the file so that data can flow into it.
         * ObjectOutputStream
         * Purpose: It is used to write Java objects (not just raw data) to a file in a
         * serialized format.
         * What it does in your code:
         * This wraps the FileOutputStream so that you can write entire Java objects
         * (like your Cricketer object) to the file.
         * It converts the object into a special format (serialization) that can be
         * stored in the file.
         * Without ObjectOutputStream, you would have to manually convert the object
         * into bytes, which is complex.
         * How They Work Together
         * FileOutputStream opens the file and provides a way to write raw data to it.
         * ObjectOutputStream uses the FileOutputStream to write a serialized version of
         * the object into the file.
         * In simple terms:
         * FileOutputStream: Opens the file for writing.
         * ObjectOutputStream: Converts the object into a storable format and sends it
         * through the FileOutputStream to the file.
